## Code Style

Basically, use semicolons, single quotes, and 2-space indents. See .eslintrc.yml and .eslintignore
for details on the style guidelines. Run `npx eslint --fix /path_to/BitBot/` or `npx eslint --ext js
--fix /path_to/BitBot/` to check and fix the style of your code. If eslint is
throwing up an error based on a bad style guideline, you can have it ignore the style guideline by
adding `  name-of-style-error: off` to the bottom of .eslintrc.yml.
